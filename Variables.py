#  Part1---- Variables and Datatypes in Python

#  Variables------ A variable is a name given to memory location in a program
#   Python is case sensitive programming language

# print("Hello world")   # Basic syntax 
# name = "Rjrohan"     # name is variable and "Rjrohan" is value that assigns to name variable
# Name = "Keshav"      # "name" & "Name" are two different variables because python is case sensitive 
# age = 19
# print("My name is",name)
# print("My name is",Name)
# print("My age is",age)
