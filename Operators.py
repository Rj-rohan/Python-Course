#    Part2---- Operators in Python

# Operators ---- An operator is a symbol that used perform operation b/w Operands
"""
Basicallly there are 4 types of operators in Python
1) Arithmatic--- (+,-,*,/,%,**)  --- For mathematical operations
2) Relational--- (<,>,<=,>=,!=,==) --- To Find relation
3) Assignment--- (=,+=,-=,*=,/=,**=,%=) --- To assign values
4) Logical------ (and,or,not) --- bits form

If i write a+b  -- (+) is a Operator and a&b are Operands

   #  Problems based on Operators

#  Que1-- Perform addition,subtraction,multiplication,division

# num1 = 100
# num2 = 50

# print(type(num1))
# print("Addition is",num1+num2)
# print("Subtraction is",num1-num2)
# print("Quotient is",num1/num2)   # Gives quotient
# print("Remainder is",num1%num2)  # Gives Remainder
# print("Square is",num2**2)

#  Que2--- Problem based on logical operator


# a = 50
# b = 100
# print(not (a>b))
# print((a>b) and (b>a))
# print((a>b) or (b>a))

# a = 3.14
# value = True
# b = None
